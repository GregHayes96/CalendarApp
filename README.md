#Calendar project

#version 8

Calendar project which can be used to enter important dates to the user, change the date, compare the dates with upcoming events to check the upcomign schedule.

Added Functions:

*Solved some issues giving errors for name of the week function. out by range error and a small math error. *Changed the Sort method to a bubble sort, wanted to try some DSA mehthods *Changed the note to now take as many characters as you would like instead of one word with an exit character of '|'

Upcoming work: *Inherited classes which are different calendars - large task to develop so will be done in stages after some more planning

The design goal once the functionality is there is to create other calendars from different dating systems around the world which can integrate with the current used Gregorian calendar
