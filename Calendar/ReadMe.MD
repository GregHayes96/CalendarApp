#Calendar project

This is going to be a project which has a fully functioning calendar, with the ability to:
Add dates
Schedule items against the current date
Change the date correctly against restrictions such as leap years

The design goal once the functionality is there is to create other calendars from different dating systems around the world which can integrate with the current used Gregorian calendar
