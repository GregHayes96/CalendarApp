#Calendar project

#version 5
Calendar project which can be used to enter important dates to the user, change the date, compare the dates with upcoming events to check the upcomign schedule. 

Added Functions:

*added an overload operator to compare two dates. Compares two Date user objects and returns the closer of the two dates.
*Calendar class now can search its stored events and return the next up coming event. can also print all the events in the calendar

Upcoming work:
*Changes to the print calednar function, would like it to print in order of the events about to happen and not the order they have been stored in the vector
*implementation of the naming of the day of the week - feature mightbe removed and added later on when overall structure works better


The design goal once the functionality is there is to create other calendars from different dating systems around the world which can integrate with the current used Gregorian calendar
